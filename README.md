## Features

- **Advanced Audio Visualization**: Interactive waveform and frequency visualizations that respond to audio playback
- **Machine Learning Analysis**: Extract musical features including genre, BPM, key, and instrument detection
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with React, Framer Motion, and Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive UI

## Live Demo

- [React Application](https://audioviz-ai.netlify.app)

## Project Structure

### Web Application (React)

The application provides a sleek interface for audio file upload, playback, and visualization:

- Real-time audio waveform visualization
- Dynamic frequency visualization 
- Interactive audio player with playback controls
- Feature extraction and analysis results

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend (React)
- React with TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- Web Audio API for audio processing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/audioviz-ai.git
cd audioviz-ai
```

2. Install frontend dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the React development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Data Sources

This project can use audio files from various sources:

- User-uploaded audio files
- Sample audio tracks included in the project
- Public datasets like GTZAN Genre Collection or FMA (Free Music Archive)

## Machine Learning Models

The project uses several machine learning models for different tasks:

1. **Genre Classification**: Convolutional Neural Network trained on spectrograms
2. **BPM Detection**: Beat tracking algorithms combined with ML regression
3. **Instrument Recognition**: Multi-label classification model
4. **Mood Detection**: Models trained on audio features correlated with emotional responses

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with music streaming APIs
- Real-time microphone input analysis
- Collaborative filtering for music recommendations
- Extended ML features for deeper audio analysis
